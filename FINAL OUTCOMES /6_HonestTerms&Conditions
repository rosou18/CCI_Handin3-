Hate to break it to you, but this app isnâ€™t free... youâ€™re the product, and your data fuels our profit-driven company and unsustainable lifestyles.
Come on, cheer up! The planet is going to die anyways!

The moment you accept, your personal information will be sold to lawless data brokers who can determine everything about you.
Your guilty pleasures, gloomy Sunday routine, your crush, medical history, where you live, and even your deepest, darkest secrets. Your search history in itself is a gold mine!

You have nothing to hide anyways... apart from that embarrassing love poem you sent to Brad Pitt. Or the late-night search about STDs. Actually, don't get me started on the hateful comments to the Crocs Convention... Privacy is an illusion anyways. We know who you really are, even when you think no oneâ€™s watching.

What could possibly happen, right? Apart from your file ending up on Axciom, the biggest data evil corporation of them all! Recently bought for a mere $2.3 billion, making it possible to buy your personal details for only $25. A badly intentioned stalker could find your details in no time. Or a hacker empties your account, or a blackmailer uses your cheeky photos against you. Maybe an employer or insurer has already combed through your medical records.
